# Pink Inference Website
A website for the Pink Inference start up based in Ann Arbor, built using React and Javascript/HTML/CSS tools

Pink Inference is a biotechnology company that specializes in making affordable micro-electrode arrays for lab research

This website was designed by the founders, using Figma, with the purpose of transforming the designs to code. Much of it matches the completed version, although there are some holes in the design. Multiple videos and links were pulled from open source online resources as placeholders, along with some missing functionalities. However, the core ideas and features of the website vision are still present and fully operational. 

The site is not currently active, due to large focus shifts within the company, but the code still expresses the process of learning web development, and the softwares and skills that go into the process.
